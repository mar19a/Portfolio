        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>"Seekers" - Real Estate Website</h3>
        <p>
          Completed on May 3, 2023, this project was a joint effort with Gary Dong for CS 411, Software Engineering, at Boston University. We created a real estate website named "Seekers" using three APIs: Zillow API, Local Business Data from RapidAPI, and News API.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website offers home for sale lookups using the Zillow API, local business recommendations based on user preferences and city data, and Massachusetts news. Users can contact our agent's services or ask questions by submitting a form. We receive a copy of all user submissions at our email, mariano@bu.edu.
        </p>
        <p>
           The website utilizes a MySQL database for user login storage and also includes Google Oauth as an additional user login option. The project has both a front end and a back end. A demo of the project can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/PlX1SiR-Ezk">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project repository can be cloned and set up with npm install for dependencies, npm install react-google-login --legacy-peer-deps for Google Oauth dependencies, and npm start to start the website. The backend server can be run with node server.js. XAMPP is also required.
        </p>
        <h3>Reddit API (Java)</h3>
        <p>
          Utilized Java and web scraping techniques to gather data from “Hot” section of a subreddit, including top posts and number of upvotes. Implemented a user-friendly API interface to allow easy access and usage. Applied data analysis techniques to extract insights and trends from gathered data.
        </p>
        <h3>Game: "Dodge Obstacles" (Java)</h3>
        <p>
          Built 2D survival genre game. Each player dodge four types of enemies at various points (basic, boss, fast, and smart enemy). Established two difficulties level and in-game shop where users can upgrade speed, health, and refill health.
        </p>

        <h3>Game: "Pacman" (Java)</h3>
        <p>
          Developed functional replica of popular game "Pacman" applying Java programming language. Incorporated all rules and mechanics of original Pacman game to ensure authenticity. Made use of various Java Foundation Classes (JFC) such as AWT and Swing to create game's interface and objects. Employed object-oriented programming principles to design and execute game, constructing it scalable and maintainable. Incorporated collision detection and handling to ensure smooth gameplay experience. Performed multithreading techniques to handle game's animation and user input. Formed scoring system and implemented ability to save and load game progress.

        <h3>Other Relevant Experiences</h3>
        <p>
          Worked with the Cybersecurity Club on a project using Azure. Developed and proposed a migration plan using Azure Site Recovery (ASR) and Azure Data Factory to migrate a client's on-premise infrastructure to the cloud. Addressed client concerns about cost, complexity, and impact on operations by providing a detailed cost-benefit analysis and migration plan.
